## Context:

You have been a developer for over a year at **CONNECT-E**, a small agency of about a dozen employees, including three project managers, four developers, a graphic designer, two salespeople, a marketing strategist, and the director, who started the agency eight years ago.

Your director, Stephanie, invites the entire agency for a drink to celebrate some good news! She has just signed a contract for a new ambitious project! ðŸ¥‚

The client in question is **Groupomania**, a large group and one of the most loyal clients of the agency.


## The Project:

The project will be to build an **internal social network** for Groupomania's employees. The goal of this tool is to facilitate more interaction between colleagues. Groupomania's HR department imagined three apps to promote exchanges between colleagues but otherwise allows for a lot of flexibility regarding the functionalities of the network.


_Reddit_ - they want employees to write and/or share articles with colleagues on topics of interest to them.


### Teamwork

For this project I had to team up with Christopher Kim, an american product manager.
-   The project manager or product manager:  
    -   prepared a customer needs analysis and a minimum functional proposal for one of the apps;
    -   defined the features to be produced in a first sprint, to discuss and finalize with me;
    -   proposed a methodology and tools to carry out the project;
    -   wrote a user story for each selected feature;
    -   found a person to test the application 
-   **Me, as the developer:**  
    -   **chose which app I wanted to build;**
    -   **estimated the time to spend on the development of each feature;**
    -   **developed the first iteration of the application.**
